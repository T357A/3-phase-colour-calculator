# 3-phase-colour-calculator
#Code was created on python 3.6. it may work on older versions.
#My first attempt at understanding python coding with an electrical wire colour "calculator"
#User can enter a circuit number and the code should return the proper wire colour to use in the wiring system.



#Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
